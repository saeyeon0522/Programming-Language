### Programming Language - PYTHON


***********************************


This course understands the characteristics of various programming languages, solves problems through algorithms with principles of program behavior, and promotes programming writing skills. In particular, in this course, Python language will help you understand the basic principles of programming and have the ability to solve problems with computing thinking. Python's basic grammar improves practical implementation skills by learning data types, conditions, iterations, arrangements, functions, and I/O, and learning programming techniques for solving various problems. 




The aims of the module are :

Learners who are new to programming will easily learn programming writing skills and apply them to cultivate the skills to easily adapt to various types of program writing skills. It also sets learning goals to motivate programming skills and knowledge acquisition and to foster creative thinking enhancement of problem-solving skills together.
